## Running the Application Locally

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine

### 2. Make the Bash Script Executable

In the root directory, where both the backend and frontend folders are located, you'll find a bash script named start-app.sh. To make this script executable, open a bash terminal and enter the following command:
```bash
chmod +x start-app.sh
```
### 3. Clone the Repository
Run the script to set up the backend, frontend, and all necessary dependencies:
```bash
./start-app.sh
```
Once the script is completed, the application will be ready to use locally.
